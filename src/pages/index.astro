			<h1>The bar will always be higher than you</h1>
			<p>
				I think and I code things. Most days these are mutually exclusive.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is where I write about software development, AI-assisted coding, and the uncomfortable
				questions you ask after the demo stops working. Expect practical takes on building tools that
				survive contact with reality, not manifestos about disruption.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're here for hype, wrong address. If you're here because you recognize the pattern
				between the printing press, the typewriter, and the LLM — and you're curious what happens
				next — stick around.
