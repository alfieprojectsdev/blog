	description="GNSS data specialist who also builds web apps. Writing about software, tools, and the gap between intent and execution."
	pubDate={new Date('November 20 2024')}

	<p>
		I work with GNSS data — the kind that tracks how the ground moves over time. I also build
		web apps. Turns out both require the same thing: precision, patience, and accepting that
		systems rarely behave the way you expect them to.
	</p>

	<p>
		The web development started as a way to build tools I needed. Then tools other people needed.
		Now I maintain parking marketplaces, lab service directories, queue management systems, and
		the occasional math worksheet generator. None of it is glamorous. All of it works.
	</p>

	<p>
		This blog exists because thinking and coding are different disciplines that pretend to be
		the same thing. When you skip the thinking part, you get demos that impress and production
		systems that collapse. When you skip the coding part, you get philosophy papers.
	</p>

	<p>
		I write here to force myself to do both. To interrogate the tools I use — especially the ones
		that promise to think for me. To document what breaks and why. To stay skeptical without
		becoming useless.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you're looking for hot takes on the latest framework, wrong place. If you want to read
		someone working through the gap between "move fast and break things" and "build things that
		actually last" — welcome.
